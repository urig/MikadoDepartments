# MikadoDepartments
A tiny example to demonstrate the Mikado Method.

The goal is to introduce a `Department` entity between `Brands` and their `Users`. 

One `Brand` can have multiple `Departments`. One `Department` can have multiple `Users`.

The `Phone` and `EmailAddress` properties should move over from `Brand` to `Department`.
